> A Rock Paper Scissors Game I created because I was bored, A simple system that allows you to play RPS when you are alone. The code isn't that great but Hey it's working. I hope you like it, you can checkout the [demo](https://rps.daangamesdg.tk/) if you want. Feel free to do with it whatever you want, use it in your project or make your own version of it.
